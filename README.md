The homework assignement is to make sure the site is accessable for people who may be hearing impaired or blind. We are to make sure the images have 'alt' tags so it can be read by the browser and can be accessable to the impaired. 

I have also wrapped semantic tags around their respective sections. 
Semantic tags that have been added to the html:
    1. Nav
    2. Header
    3. Section
    4. Aside
    5. Footer

I have also added a descriptive Title to the head tag.
