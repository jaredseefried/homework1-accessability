<strong>Homework 1: Accessibility and Refactoring </strong>

The task is to refactor the website to meet accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities. We are to make sure the images have 'alt' tags so it can be read by the browser and can be accessible to the impaired. 

The index.html file was updated the following improvements. 

1. The sections of the website were wrapped in their appropriate semantic elements. 
    Semantic tags that have been added to the html:
        1. Nav
        2. Header
        3. Section
        4. Aside
        5. Footer

2. The 'title' tag was updated to be more descriptive.  

3. 'alt' tags were added to their images to meet ADA standards. 

The style.css file was updated with the following improvements. 

1. CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

2. Sections were commented appropriately.
